<h3>The founders started a Senior College Huzurpaga, Smt. Durgabai Mukunddas Lohiya Mahila Vanijya Mahavidyalaya (Formerly Huzurpaga Mahila Vanijya Mahavidyalaya) in September 2001. The idea for starting this college was to educate women and equip them to face challenges in the coming future. Thousands of women have secured higher education from our institution.

    The college is affiliated to the Savitribai Phule Pune University and is recognized by the Government of Maharashtra. It is located in the heart of the city and provides quality education in Commerce in a secure environment. 'Quality' and 'Huzurpaga' have become synonyms and this fact is known to all. The M. G. E. Society constantly encourages and supports the college in its academic development. A shining example of this is the brand new building with the latest infrastructural facilities which has been built for our students on the Laxmi Road campus.
    
    In 2001 the college started with a good number of students with two divisions. Gradually we got a tremendous response and now we have around one thousand plus students. Besides the B.Com degree we also offer B.B.A. and B.B.A (Computer Applications) degree courses.</h3>
